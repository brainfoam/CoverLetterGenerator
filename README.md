# Cover Letter Generator v1.0
Cover Letter Generator is a piece of software I wrote to help manage and create new cover letters for job applications, meetings, and proposals. The software works by taking pieces of information created and inserted by the user through external files and using PDF API iTextSharp to generate a document.

## Syntax
Within the letter.txt file, certain syntax is used to inject user-information into your letter body. "$C" is used to insert the company name, and "$P" is used to insert the position. Other syntax is planned for implementation in the future.
